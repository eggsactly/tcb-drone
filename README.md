# About
tcb-drone measures tree health from aerial photographs from drone flyovers of Tucson Clean and Beautiful planting locations. This project enables automated surveys of tree survival to provide data to improve neighborhood heat resilience.

## Technical
This git project implements neural networks and machine learning to identify trees and assess tree health. This project leverages TensorFlow to implement machine learning algorithms to assess tree health based on aerial photographs of trees.

# Setup
Once this repo is cloned, developers may setup their development enviroment by running
```
./initialize-enviroment.sh
```
which will install TensorFlow locally in the development sandbox.

If the developer wishes to employ a GPU to accelerate training runtimes, and is on a system that uses an nVidia GPU and has CUDA installed, the developer may setup their development enviroment by running:
```
./initialize-enviroment.sh GPU
```

# Google Streetview script
Training images from google's streetview API can be queried by running streetview-query.py. The script expects a google API key in the file `~/.google-api-key`, or in a file specified by `-a/--api_key_file` at the command line. The script queries random locations in a radius around a latitute and longitude coordinate - the radius (in miles), center latitude, and center longitude can be modified by updating the `RADIUS` and `TUCSON_DATA` global variables. By default, the script queries for 5 images, but can query for more by specifying `-n/--numqueries` in the cli.
Note: Rerunning the script with the same inputs will recreate the same images, as the random function is seeded.
Note: If a randomly generated coordinate does not have available streetview data within 50m, a line will be printed to stdout and no image will be generated for that set of coordinates

# Project Progress and Tracking
A [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/RLBbTfDf/tcb-drone-survey) is being used
for project progress and task tracking.
